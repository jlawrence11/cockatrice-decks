# Cockatrice Decks

This will get more fleshed out as I go through organizing the decks my friend and I have already assembled. A couple notes though, some of these at least started as decks assembled by others. No claims are being made on these decks, and the purpose of this repo is to give more people accessible decks to be able to play and even possibly learn from. The hope being the more accessible it is, the bigger the community. I never planned on creating a repo, so my personal decks don't have sources if they started from elsewhere. I will try and track those down and add the urls to the comments.

## Filename
This is open to suggestions, but current naming schema I'm trying to conform to currently is: `<format>-<Deck Name>.cod`

## Deck Meta-Data
### Deck Name
The deck name you used in the filename, but with extra flourishes if preferred.

### Comments
Anything in brackets (`[]`) is optional and will still fit the criteria of being complete with regards to the comments.
Items in gt/lt symbols (`<>`) is meant to be descriptive of what is suppose to go there.
*Neither of those sets of symbols are included in the actual format.*
```
["<Slogan>"]
FORMAT: <EDH/Standard/Brawl/ETC>
[CDR: <Commander>]
[Alt CDR: <Alt Commander>]
Colors: <B, U, G, R, W>
[TAGS: <Aggro/Lifegain/Sacrifice/ETC>]
[Est Cost $]
[URL: <If based on another deck>]
[TIPS:
Any tips on how it plays, etc]
```
* `"Slogan"`: If there a fun slogan/secondary title to attach to the deck.
* `CDR`: Commander, if there are 2 commanders (Partner Mechanic) list both as `CDR`
* `Alt CDR`: Alternative Commander Option(s)
* `Colors`: B = Black; U = Blue. *(Same as Cockatrice filters)*.
* `TAGS`: All the tags the deck could/should be classified under to help understand the play style quickly.
* `Est Cost`: To help play groups interested in trying to play comparable cost decks as a way to not be completely overpowered. *(Paste deck in to [https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/paste/] to easily get estimated cost.)*
* `URL`: If the deck started off somewhere online, even if modified, let's try and credit the authors here.
* `TIPS`: Any and all commentary you would like to include with your deck for someone that may potentially be looking to play it. Not required, but even as much as listing tags

### Banner Card
If the deck has a commander, the banner card should be set to the suggested commander for that deck. If the deck has no commander, the banner card should be one the exemplifies the deck.
